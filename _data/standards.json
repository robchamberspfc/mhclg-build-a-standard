It was also developed in cooperation with the statistical agencies of Canada and Mexico to establish a 3-country standard that allows for a high level of comparability in business statistics among the three countries.\nNAICS is the first economic classification system to be constructed based on a single economic concept. The current version incorporated into OSCRE is the 2017 edition valid through 2022."

The Standard Industrial Classification (SIC) was originally developed in the 1930’s to classify establishments by industry. The purpose of this task was to promote the comparability of establishment data to describe the US Economy. In the United States the SIC code is being supplanted by the six-digit North American Industry Classification System (NAICS code), which was released in 1997; however certain government departments and agencies, such as the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), and Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) still use the SIC Codes."

Where multiple levels of the spatial hierarchy are provided, the most constraining applies. In the example, if two floors and the containing property were referenced, the subject could not exist on floors other than the two specified in the specified property.

Under the definitions of the Scopes from the Government’s Environmental Reporting Guidelines it is still a Scope 3 even though the employer reimburses the cost of fuel as it doesn’t directly buy the fuel or own or control the vehicle that is burning the fuel. A good way of explaining the reason is that for an employee owned car, the employer has no say on whether this is a Tesla (or other battery EV) or a huge diesel truck and so have minimal control over the fuel used and no ownership of the vehicle. Alternatively, if an employee had to travel for work they (hopefully!) have a choice on whether to use their own car or use public transport to get there. It's similar to a subcontracted maintenance fleet – the employer will be paying them to do the maintenance, but the sub-contractor is buying the fuel for the vans so it is in that organisations Scope 1 and employer’s Scope 3 emissions. Company pool cars are treated completely differently as Scope 1 as the employer will buy the fuel, similar to any in house maintenance/estates/capital works teams vans and vehicles.",

A Space must be entirely contained within one and only one Floor.

Spaces are often defined so as to have a single expected use of each Space, or to provide a simple way of expressing the allocation of the responsibility for the Space (cost, maintenance etc.) to a particular party or contractual agreement. Whatever scheme is used to determine how a Floor is decomposed in to Spaces, each scheme should result in a set of Spaces that do not overlap, and that - in an appropriate context - can be used to aggregate Space level information to Floor level: for example, establishing the measured area of a Floor by summing the measured areas of each Space in a particular scheme that belongs to that Floor. Although Spaces are expressed in terms of a bounding line on a plan, this should be interpreted as necessary in context to include the volume described by extruding the polyline on the plan upwards to the vertical limit of the floor (and - if necessary - downwards to sub-floor space as far as the vertical limit of the floor).",

In this circumstance the Current Landlord component will hold the details and reference of the SPV or fund, typically with this being the reference in the Landlord's property management system. The Solicitor will therefore not provide any new data in this respect but will provide this reference back to the Landlord for the purpose of automatically matching the legal Landlord record in the Landlord's property management system.A Party can be used to define a Company, Individual or Partnership.",

Anything more than a half-day appointment slot is not considered an appointment.\n \n Appointments are not usually considered necessary for emergency repairs, which should be completed as soon as possible. However, appointments can usually be made for other repairs whether inside or outside of the property and for communal areas (where an appointment could be made with a scheme manager, caretaker, or other member of staff or tenant who reported the repair). Some landlords also offer a same-day repair service for which they book an appointment. These appointments can be included so long as an appointment is actually made.\n \n Where a repair requires multiple separate visits to complete, then the appointments for each separate visit should be counted. If a repair takes multiple continuous working days to complete, then the appointment should be counted as a single event which is the time slot at which the operative is due to arrive to start the work.\n \n In Scotland, this a component of Charter regulatory PI 14.",
